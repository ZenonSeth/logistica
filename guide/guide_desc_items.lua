g.mass_storage_upgrade = S([[
Mass Storage upgrades increase the capacity of the Mass Storage machine.

There are two types, as seen above.

Note that you cannot remove Mass Storage upgrades from a Mass Storage machine if removing the upgrade will result in insufficient storage available for any of the stacks stored in the machine.

g.cobblegen_upgrade = S([[
Cobblestone Generator Upgrades are added the Cobble Generator Supplier.

Each upgrade doubles the rate of cobblestone output.

g.wireless_access_pad = S([[
The Wireless Access Pad is a handheld device that allows you to access your Network Storage from potentially unlimited distance by synchronizing to an Access Point on your network. (distance may be limited by server settings, see Server Setting page on the left)

The Wireless Access Pad has no relation to the Wireless Transmitter or Receiver. The Pad only requres an Access Point.

The Wireless Access Pad provides the exact same interface as the Access Point, allowing you to store or retrieve items or liquids.

To use a Wireless Access Pad:

1. Craft one via the recipe. Tip: the Wireless Crystals are made in a Lava Furnace.
2. Craft a Wireless Upgrader machine, and use it to Upgrade your Wireless Access Pad as many times as you need (see Wireless Upgrader).
3. Sneak + Punch an Access Point with the Wireless Access Pad - if successful, you will see a short message appear.
4. Use the Wireless Access Pad from anywhere within its current range to open the Access Point and take or store items remotely!

If you need more range, just place it in a Wireless Upgrader and repeat the upgrade process!

g.hyperspanner = S([[
A multipurpose engineering tool.

- Use (right-click on PC) it on Logistica nodes to get information about which network, if any, the node is connected to. This does not use or damage the Hyperspanner.
- Sneak + Use it on a Logistica node to get more information about the network, if any, to which the machine is connected to.

- Combined with a Photonizer or a Photonizer (Reversed Polarity) in the crafting grid, it will turn one into the other. This does not use or damage the Hyperspanner.

g.silverin_crystal = S([[
Silverin Crystals are the base for other craft items, some of which can be made in the regular crafting grid, some of which require the use of the Lava Furnace (and are listed in the Lava Furnace's built-in crafting guide).

See the Lava Furnace's built-in guide.
]])

g.silverin_slice = S([[
8 of them are Made from a single Silverin Crystal, the process can also be reversed - 8 slices = 1 crystal.

They are used in the lava furnace as a basis for a few other crafting components, which in turn are used in many machines.

See the Lava Furnace's built-in guide.
]])

g.silverin_circuit = S([[
Made in the Lava Furnace, these circuits are used as basis for many machines.

See the Lava Furnace's built-in guide.
]])

g.silverin_mirror_box = S([[
A piece of glass surrounded by sliverin crystals, and baked to perfection. This allows the creation of Wave Function Maintainer, which are in turn, the basis for all storage.

See the Lava Furnace's built-in guide.
]])

g.silverin_plate = S([[
Silverin Plates are made in the Lava Furnace using 1 Silverin Crystal as input and 1 Steel Ingot as additive. See furnace's built-in recipe guide for details.

In addition to being used for the construction of almost all machines, the Silverin Plate can be placed as a node.

3 Silverin Plates can also make a Silverin Block, which is a purely decorateive item. This crafting process is reversible.

See the Lava Furnace's built-in guide.

g.compression_tank = S([[
A tank capable of compressing liquids when used in the right machine. Used for creation of Reservoirs.
]])

g.photonizers = S([[
The regular Photonizer is made in normal crafting grid from other materials, but can also be made from a Reversed Polarity Photonizer using a Hyperspanner by combining them in the grid.

The Photonizer (Reverse Polarity) is only made by comibing a hyperspanner and a normal Photonizer in the crafting grid.

The Photonizer's job is to convert matter, aka items, into wave packets which can then be transmitted over the Logistic Network, and stored in machines. This is why the Photonizer is a vital component in any machine that can add items to the Logistics Network.

The Revered Polarity Photonizer does the opposite - it takes wave packets and converts them into items. Thus it is used in many machines that are capable of taking items from the Logistics Network.
]])

g.wave_func_main = S([[
The Wave Function Maintainer is a component that can "store" (aka maintain) wave packets indefinitely, when used in the right machine. This allows photonized matter to essentially be stored in it.

g.wireless_crystal = S([[
The wireless crystal is an essential component to crafting the Wireless Access Pad and Wireless Upgrader. It is made in the Lava Furnace.

See furnace's built-in recipe guide for details

g.wireless_antenna = S([[
The Wireless Antenna is an essential component to crafting the Wireless Transmitter and Wireless Receiver. It is made on the regular crafting grid using the recipe above.
