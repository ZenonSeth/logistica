"Logistica is an item storage and transportation mod.\n"

"It provides easy to use storage that can be used standalone, or connected to "

"The Logistic network is able to transport items - both taking from other "

"works on-demand: only the exact amount of items needed are moved. \n"

"Logistica also provides a way to access all your storage remotely, from "

"The Lava Furnace has a built-in recipe guide, accessed by clicking the [?] "

"There are 2 recipes for Silverin Crystals, one that uses Snow as the "
